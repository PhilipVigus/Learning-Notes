Careers stuff

Key moment - recovering from illness, not knowing what to do, my wife suggested I look at it and for some reason the idea really hit home at that moment
Tech possibilities - anything that connects people and allows communication and the sharing of ideas where it would otherwise be difficult or impossible
5 top companies - somewhere in Canada, ethically sound practice
Non-negotiables - Supportive, good with training and on boarding, care about.CPD and give opportunities to grow and develop, not too much/any travelling, relative security
Career change - a chance to prove myself to myself, and accept that I can be and am good at something

Put the newest project at the top of the list
Skills section is vital - 2 or three stories
Use concrete things for impact - x% better etc

Tech CV workshop

title, description, timeframe, tech used, libraries/frameworks etc used
skills
education
interests

Github CVs

Github CVs are allowed to be wordy as there aren't covering letters - this matters for jobs applied for through Makers
Use icons for links
use screenshots for projects
have a website
Projects are all important

Profile - first impression. Think of it as being the only thing a person reads. That should be enough to make them want to invite you into interview. My Computer Science degree MUST, MUST, MUST be included here, as well as anything else computer related. Background - what am I passionate about? What relevant work experience have I had? Include the trailer thing, because I did this before Makers. Hyperlink to Makers rather than explain them. Use hyperlinks. Add a blog link at the top, as well as your personal website. Include the pre-makers project front and centre. It shows distance travelled, drive, how it drove you to get to makers etc.

Projects - Include them, shout about them. They don't need to be complete and all bells-and-whistles. They can help you stand out. What makes you different. Summarise skills here? 3-5 projects on CV by the end of makers. Still needs to be right at the top even if the CV is pdf and you are applying outside. Unfinished ones are fine too.

Resume building sites - enhancv.com

Don't include ratings of how good you are - it invites awkward questions

Skills - be creative. Bullet points, Evidence, evidence evidence, soft and technical, but focus on soft skills (problem solving etc), you can make soft skills technical by giving technical examples of using soft skills. Mind map it out. Ask others what they love about me, include mentoring. Be sure you can answer questions about the tech you reference and mention on your CV

Education - include Makers, go back as far as degree - you don't need to put the result. Perhaps include a-levels but not essential

Work experience - keep it short, concise and to the point. Skills can do all the heavy lifting. No more than a line, with up to 3 bullet points for really, really important

Interests/hobbies - meetups, the external code stuff, volunteering on open code stuff, mentoring etc

Think about blogging stuff about my journey so that it doesn't have to go on my CV

Generally don't duplicate information in multiple places (in general, but break it if you feel its appropriate) - be concise, not brief
