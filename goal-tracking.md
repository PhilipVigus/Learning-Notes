# Week 1

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods. A specific weakness I have is breaking a problem down into individual tests and working out the order in which to implement those tests
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
- Become familiar with remote-working

### Plan

- Work through Boris Bike challenge. Concentrate on the navigator/driver dynamic
- Follw the debugging procedure that we learnt on day 2 rigidly until it becomes second nature
- Work through the practicals relating to TTD
- Revise OO principles from previous learning

### Evidence

- TODO

### Daily - Tuesday

- Goal - Become more comfortable with debugging
	- Plan - Work through the Debugging Approaches practical
	- Evidence - Exercise completed with screencap videos
	- Retrospective - The exercise definitely helped, and by the end I was much more comfortable with the process and taking my time to understand the code rather than plowing in and making semi-random changes
- Goal - Practice TDD
	- Plan	- Work through TDD exercises
	- Evidence - TODO
	- Retrospective - TODO
