# GitHub collaboration
1. In order to collaborate with one or more partners:
2. Create the repo on your computer
3. Commit
4. Create the repo on GitHub
5. Push to the GitHub repo
6. Invite your collaboration parter on the GitHub repo
7. They must accept or they won't get collaboration recognition
8. The partner clones the GitHub repo
9. The partner can now commit to the clone and push to the same GitHub repo

After this point you can specify the origin on your local repo to point to a different GitHub repo for example, allowing someone else to collaborate on that repo instead.
