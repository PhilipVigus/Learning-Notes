# Readmes

Readme files are an essential part of a GitHub repository as they give others information about what it contains, why and how to use it.

Typical contents might include (bold items are essential:

- **Title**
- **Project purpose**
- **Configuration and installation instructions**
- **How to run it (command-line, deployment, ports etc)**
- **How to run its tests**
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments
- A changelog (usually for programmers)
- A news section (usually for users)

If a file in your repo is titled README.md, it will automatically be displayed on the repo's front page.

Here is an example of a barebones template:
