You'll have 5 minutes to present.

Try to practice your presentation at least once, but don't spend ages polishing it.

Focus your presentation on each part of the assessment criteria

a snapshot of your test coverage and quality
your deployment pipeline
how you documented your learning and worked as a team
Please demo a user using your app!

Testing
 90% or greater test coverage.
 Unit tests:
 test one piece of your own logic.
 fail if that logic breaks.
 pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
 You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
 Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.
Good distribution of work
 Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can:
 explain why any part of the application exists (what user need it solves).
 explain how any aspect of the application works.
 Every member of the team has made commits.
 Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request.
Quality of work
 Commit messages are clear and composed of:
 a single line describing the changes made.
 a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user.
 The Linter passes on all commits.
 All commits have a low complexity score.
 All pull requests are peer reviewed.
Documentation
 There is up-to-date documentation:
 a project description.
 how to install and run it.
 how to run tests.
It's also a great idea for your team to keep some sort of record of your learning process. This could take the form of a blog, a wiki or any other format you like.

Additional Criteria â€“ Weeks 8 and 9 (Engineering Projects)
Merging any branch into master automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
All code on master is containerized.
master is deployed into production.
