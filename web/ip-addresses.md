# IP Addresses

Internet Protocol addresses are numerical labels that devices connected to a network use to identify themselves for communication and show where they are.

- IPv4, eg 172.16.254.1 - a 32-bit number. These started running out, so IPv6 was introduced
- IPv6, eg 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 - a 128-bit number

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and 5 regional internet registers manage the IP space.
