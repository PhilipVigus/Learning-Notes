#### Emphasis

- *Italics* - surround with a single asterisk or underscore
- **Bold** - surround with two
- ***Both*** - surround with three
- ~~Strikethrough~~ - surround with double tilde

#### Lists
- For ordered lists, start each line with a number
- For unordered lists, start with an asterisk, minus or plus
- For sublists, indent by at least one space	
- To do properly indented paragraphs, leave a blank line and indent with at least one space.
- To line break without a paragraph, use two trailing spaces

#### Links
- For inline, surround the text with square brackets and put the link in round ones
- Links can be relative file paths to other files in the same repo

#### Images
- Similar to links, but preceed the opening square bracket with a bang

#### Blockquotes
- Start the line with >

#### Inline HTML
- Generally works as expected

#### Horizontal Rules
- Use three or more dashes, asterisks or underscores
