# Exchanging feedback

Productivity depends on all parties giving clear, kind and skillful feedback. 

### Giving skillful feedback

#### 1. Shift your perspective

- Try to think of feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than a threat, whoever is giving it
- As the receiver of feedback, you decide whether or not to take it onboard. Be skillful in the way you extract learning and growth no matter the quality of the feedback you receive

#### 2. Know yourself

- Think about how you feel when you receive feedback. How long does that response last for? What are you insecure about? Be self-aware
Avoid 'wrong-spotting' where you focus on what's wrong about the feedback you're getting. Don't reject feedback too quickly, as you might miss out on something you can learn from. Wrongness triggers can be:
	- truth - something just feeling off or wrong about it
	- relationship - something wrong related to who is giving it
	- identity - something clashes with how you see yourself
	
	Be aware of your blindspots that other people might be able to see.
	
#### 3. Use a framework

ASK is good for day-to-day stuff, while NVC is better for deeper things

#### ASK

- **Actionable** - be clear as to what the recipient can do to improve. Avoid vagueness

	*“You’re not engaging” => “When you check your phone frequently during pairing sessions, I find it distracting.”*
	
- **Specific** - stick to facts rather than opinions
	
	*“You don’t communicate well” =>  “When working with you, I would feel more comfortable if you slowed your speech and explained technical concepts more thoroughly because I need time to process what isn’t yet familiar to me.”*
	
- **Kind** - be careful about how you generally come across

#### NVC (Non-violent Communication)

1. Observation (When I see/hear...)
	factual rather than subjective
2. Feeling (I feel...)
	avoids blaming them, stops them feeling defensive
3. Need (Because I need to...)
	helps them understand you on a personal level
4. Request (Would you be willing to...)
	a request, not an order

### In general remember

- We can only change ourselves and influence others
- You are responsible to and not for others
- How you respond is your choice
- People usually want to give their best
- If someone is hurt, they're more likely to hurt others
- Everyone needs to know they matter
- People are more collaborative if they're engaged and valued
