# Exchanging feedback

Productivity depends on all parties giving clear, kind and skillful feedback. 

### Giving skillful feedback

#### 1. Shift your perspective

- Try to think of feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than a threat, whoever is giving it
- As the receiver of feedback, you decide whether or not to take it onboard. Be skillful in the way you extract learning and growth no matter the quality of the feedback you receive

#### 2. Know yourself

- Think about how you feel when you receive feedback. How long does that response last for? What are you insecure about? Be self-aware
Avoid 'wrong-spotting' where you focus on what's wrong about the feedback you're getting. Don't reject feedback too quickly, as you might miss out on something you can learn from. Wrongness triggers can be:
	- truth - something just feeling off or wrong about it
	- relationship - something wrong related to who is giving it
	- identity - something clashes with how you see yourself
	
	Be aware of your blindspots that other people might be able to see.
	
#### 3. Use a framework

ASK is good for day-to-day stuff, while NVC is better for deeper things

#### ASK

- **Actionable** - be clear as to what the recipient can do to improve. Avoid vagueness

	*“You’re not engaging” => “When you check your phone frequently during pairing sessions, I find it distracting.”*
	
- **Specific** - stick to facts rather than opinions
	
	*“You don’t communicate well” =>  “When working with you, I would feel more comfortable if you slowed your speech and explained technical concepts more thoroughly because I need time to process what isn’t yet familiar to me.”*
	
- **Kind** - be careful about how you generally come across

#### NVC (Non-violent Communication)

1. Observation (When I see/hear...)
	factual rather than subjective
2. Feeling (I feel...)
	avoids blaming them, stops them feeling defensive
3. Need (Because I need to...)
	helps them understand you on a personal level
4. Request (Would you be willing to...)
	a request, not an order
		
### General tips on giving feedback

- Make sure you know why you're giving it
- Prepare, give it some structure
- Ask permission and respect their boundaries
- State the purpose
- Start softly, thank them for something, be genuine
- Use facts not stories
- Be direct and respectful
- Aim to help them grow, be kind
- Keep an open mind, don't assume you're right
- Thank them for listening
- Ask if they have any feedback for you

### General tips for receiving feedback

- Make sure you're in the right place. If not, give a rain-check
- Be aware of the triggers (truth, relationship and identity)
- Listen attentively with an open mind
- Be aware of your blind spots
- Know your boundaries, and if you have to, reject feedback respectfully
- Take it onboard and state what you're going to do about it
- Thank the giver
	
### In general remember

- We can only change ourselves and influence others
- You are responsible to and not for others
- How you respond is your choice
- People usually want to give their best
- If someone is hurt, they're more likely to hurt others
- Everyone needs to know they matter
- People are more collaborative if they're engaged and valued

EQ - Feedback

Aspects of self-awareness, self-regulation and social skills (+ empathy)

Understanding feedback

What is feedback?

* Lots of forms, gives clarification
* Letting someone know how their behaviour affected you
* Information about reactions to a prdict, performance, behaviour that is used as the basis for improvement

Why is giving feedback difficult?

* Worrying about making the other person feel bad/uncomfortable, which can cause them to shut down or become defensive
* Might not have the solution to the feedback
* Emotions are involved
* Can be hard to articulate, which confuses the person
* Can impact on team dynamics
* Can feel you are attacking the person rather than their work
* Who am I to give feedback? Am I credible/not arrogant?

Receiving feedback?

* If it's something you already know
* It can be subjective, and get muddy depending on the feedback
* It can be tough to change yourself

All of this is based on ***FEAR***

The main point of tension is - love and acceptance vs learning and growth
Self-protection hurts - feedback is everywhere

How can we make feedback easier?

* Shift your perspective
	* Don't see feedback as positive/negative, it's about improvement so all feedback is good, even if you reject it
	* Feedback is kind, a gift 	
* Empower the receiver
	* Get excited about feedback
	* Getting feedback makes you resilient 
	* It makes you more successful with challenges, work etc
	* Become the gatekeeper, decide whether to reject
	* Practice boundaries and assertiveness
	* Learn and grow
	* It's free therapy
* Know thyself
	* 3 triggers to watch out for. Know your triggers within each of these. Look for the 1% nugget within the 99% that some feedback is made up off
		* truth - seems wrong or off target
			* what do you know, you weren't there
		* relationship - something about the relationship with the person
			* different reaction depending on who the person is giving you the feedback
		* identity - undermines how you see yourself
			* at odds with your self-perception
	* Wrong-spotting
		* Look for the wrong thing, ignore the more objective is
	* We all have blind-spots about who we are and how other people might react to that
* Understand feedback
	* Appreciation, evaluation and coaching are the three types of feedback
	* We need all three types
		* I enjoyed pairing with you today
		* You really know your way around Pry
		* You're rushing, and I'm not keeping up. Can you repeat that please
	* All of it is there to improve, whether positive or negative
* Use a framework
	* ASK
		* actionable
		* specific
		* kind
			* couch it in the right terms and make it palatable
	* Communication stances
		* Doormat, sword, lantern (adult-adult)
	* Non-violent communication
		* Observation
			* Data not stories
		* Feeling
			* How it made you feel
		* Need
			* What I need
		* Request	  
			* Not a command 
How do we build resilience

* Understand your profile, what your triggers are
	* Understanding of baseline happiness, what's your norm (and that other people have different baselines)
		* Your baseline ***can*** be changed 
			* Mindfulness, meditation
			* Oxford Happiness Questionaire
	* Swing
		* How deeply do you emote
			* How deep are your troughs, how high are your peaks?
	* Recovery/Sustain times
		* Notice these, be aware and expect them so you don't beat yourself up if it takes time to recover
