# Pair programming

Pair programming is a programming technique where two people work together on the same code at the same time. It helps improve code quality, the rate at which you learn, communication and teamwork.

It can be a very intense process, and it's important that you take breaks regularly. 

#### Driver and navigator roles

When pairing, one person is the driver and one is the navigator. The driver does the actual typing, while the navigator is responsible for thinking more broadly about the code's direction, looking up documentation, acting as a sounding board.

Pairs should swap roles regularly (every 15 minutes or so)

#### General tips

Make sure you:

- talk
- listen
- rotate roles
- be patient
- respect each other
- take breaks
- prepare for the session
- have fun
- don't be bossy or intimidated
