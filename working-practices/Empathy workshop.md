# Empathy workshop

Sense and imagine what someone else is thinking or feeling and use that information to be proactive

## Why is empathy important as a software developer?

* Putting yourself in the shoes of a junior developer and understanding what they're going through
* Helping understand the user/customer. Developer brains are different, and you scan a website in a different way to a user who might be using it. Also, things like accessibility
* Pairing
* Teamwork
* Our technical aptitude depends on our ability to work with others. Without the latter, the former will be stunted and take a long time to grow
* Coding is a team sport
* The higher the group EQ, the higher the IQ will go up
* Motivate people
* Deal with others' negativity
* It makes you a better leader, follower and friend

The 5 domains of emotional intelligence

* Empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation and social skills

## 5 dysfunctions of a team
Pyramid with trust at the bottom. An absence of trust leads to fear of conflict, which leads to a lack of commitment etc

* Inattention to results
* avoidance of accountability
* lack of commitment
* fear of conflict
* absence of trust

Empaty builds trust

Three types of empathy

* affective
	* not being driven to help
* empathic
	* consciously understand and internalise, driven to help and respond. **You are not responsible for someone elses emotions**
* cognitive
	* consciously imagine what someone is feeling but it is not internalised (eg doctors)

Why can empathy be missing?

* Anger - towards the person or situation
* Protection - self-protection from 'catching' the emotion
* Identifying - too close to home, pain points, rationalise/talk them out or fix it to avoid your own emotions
* Fear of intimacy - easier than the risk of vulnerability and closeness
* Not being in the right headspace - already being overwhelmed etc

Training empathy

* "Just like me"
	* Higher in empathy towards someone you have things in common with
	* a simple mantra. "Just like me..." the person wants to be happy, avoid suffering, is seeking to fill their needs etc
* Metta Bhavana
	* Loving kindness meditation (look on youtube)
	* May you be happy - shift to wishing someone well and connecting with the commonality that you have
* Empathetic Active Listening
	* Reflect back (paraphrase)
	* Ask questions, don't give answers
	* Validate emotions even if you disagree with the logic
	* Don't offer unsolicited advice
	* Be present - 80/20 listening (80% full attention)
