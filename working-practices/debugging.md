# Debugging

When you're setting up to work for the first time:

- Check the environment is setup by doing something really basic like:
```
puts “hello”
```
- Check that the code inputs are as you would expect
- Break the problem down into smaller and smaller pieces until they’re really easy to solve
- Always run your program to check it works, saying what you think it will do first (in your head or out loud)
- Regularly run the code you’re writing to make sure it works every time you add or change a line

When you debug:

1. **Wring useful info out of the error message**
Make sure you really understand the error message
2. **Tighten the loop**
Find the first wrong line, which isn’t necessarily the line the error message points to
3. **Get visibility**
Look at variables etc
4. **Fix the bug**
Only when you’re sure you know what the problem is
